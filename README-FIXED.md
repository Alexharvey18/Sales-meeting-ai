# Sales Meeting AI Enhanced Features - Fixed Version

## Fixes Applied

This version contains several important fixes to ensure the modules work correctly:

1. **Mock Server API Endpoint**: Added missing `/company` and `/api/company` endpoints to the mock server to properly respond to company data requests.

2. **Integration Script Improvements**:
   - Added API endpoint redirection to properly handle API calls whether they're made to the server or directly
   - Added fallback mechanisms for script loading
   - Better error handling for API requests

3. **Tab Creation Enhancement**:
   - Now properly creates tabs if they don't exist
   - Adds tab content containers
   - Includes styling and icons for better visibility

4. **Search Integration Improvements**:
   - Now detects and works with multiple types of search inputs
   - Adds event listeners to search buttons
   - Better handles search results

5. **CSS Styling Added**:
   - Added `module-styles.css` for consistent styling of all module elements
   - Proper tab highlighting and transitions
   - Better visual structure for module content

## Deployment Instructions

1. Upload the `salesmeetingai-fixed.zip` file to Netlify using their drag-and-drop interface.

2. Before uploading, ensure the mock server is running locally at the default port (3001):
   ```
   node mock-data-server.js
   ```

3. For local testing, open `debug.html` to verify module loading:
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/debug.html
   ```

4. When deployed to Netlify, modify the API_BASE_URL in index-integration.js if you need to point to a different backend.

## Troubleshooting

If modules still don't appear after searching:

1. Check the browser console for any errors
2. Verify that your mock server is running and accessible
3. Make sure you're entering a company name in the search field
4. Try the debug page (debug.html) first to check what might be wrong

If Netlify deployment fails:

1. Verify that all files were included in the zip
2. Check Netlify's build logs for any errors
3. Ensure your function handlers are properly set up if you're using API endpoints
