# Sales Meeting AI - Netlify Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the fixed version of Sales Meeting AI to Netlify, addressing the "page not found" issue.

## What's Fixed

The `salesmeetingai-netlify-fixed.zip` package includes these critical fixes:

1. **Proper Netlify Configuration**: 
   - Updated `netlify.toml` with correct redirects for API endpoints and SPA routing
   - Added handling for the `/company` endpoint specifically

2. **Improved Netlify Functions**:
   - Added a dedicated serverless function for handling API requests
   - Implemented mock data generation to ensure the app works without external APIs

3. **Enhanced Client Code**:
   - Modified `index-integration.js` to detect Netlify vs. local environments
   - Added adaptive API routing based on deployment environment
   - Improved fallback mechanisms for module loading

## Deployment Steps

1. **Download the Fixed Package**:
   - Use the `salesmeetingai-netlify-fixed.zip` file

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Log in to your [Netlify account](https://app.netlify.com/)
   - Go to the Sites section
   - Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
   - Drag and drop the `salesmeetingai-netlify-fixed.zip` file to the designated area
   - Wait for deployment to complete (usually takes less than a minute)

3. **Verify the Deployment**:
   - Once deployed, click on the URL Netlify provides
   - Test the application by searching for a company
   - Verify all six tabs appear and display mock data

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Netlify Function Logs**:
   - In Netlify dashboard, go to "Functions" section to view logs
   - Look for any errors in the API function execution

2. **Verify Redirects**:
   - Check "Deploys" → "Deploy details" → "Redirects" to ensure rules are active
   - The `/api/*` path should redirect to the Netlify function

3. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Try opening the site in an incognito/private window
   - Or clear your browser cache completely

4. **Check for CORS Issues**:
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Look in the Console tab for any CORS-related errors

## Local Testing

You can also test the fixed package locally before deploying:

1. Install the Netlify CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. Extract the ZIP file and run:
   ```
   cd netlify-fixed
   netlify dev
   ```

3. This will simulate the Netlify environment locally, including functions
