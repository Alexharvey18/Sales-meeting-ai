## Deployment Instructions

1. **Delete Previous Deployment** (if applicable):

   - Find your previous deployment and click "Site settings"
   - Scroll to bottom and click "Delete this site"
   - Confirm deletion to start fresh

2. **Create New Site**:
   - Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
   - Drag and drop the `salesmeetingai-netlify-fixed-v3.zip` file
   - Wait for deployment to complete

3. **Check Site Setup**:
   - After deployment, visit `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/check.html`
   - This diagnostic page will tell you if the site is working correctly
   - Click the "Check Site Files" and "Check API" buttons to verify everything loads

4. **If Issues Persist**:
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Go to "Deploys" → click on the latest deploy
   - Check "Deploy log" for any errors
   - Go to "Functions" to verify the API function was deployed

## Using the Site After Deployment

1. **Access the Application**:
   Either of these will work:
   - `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/`
   - `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/dist/index.html`

2. **Using the Debug Panel**:
   - A debug panel is automatically shown in the bottom right corner
   - Use it to test API connections and module loading
   - Check the panel logs for any errors

3. **Diagnostic Tools**:
   - `/check.html` - Tests all site components and API functionality
   - `/dist/debug.html` - Module-specific debug page
   - `/.netlify/functions/api/company?name=TestCompany` - Direct API test

## Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"Page not found" error persists**:
   - Try clearing your browser cache completely
   - Try in an incognito/private window
   - Check the Netlify redirects are active in Site settings → Domain management → Redirects

2. **API calls failing**:
   - Check Functions tab in Netlify dashboard
   - Try direct access to `/.netlify/functions/api/company?name=TestCompany`
   - Check browser console for CORS errors

3. **Modules not loading**:
   - Check browser console for script loading errors
   - Use the debug panel's "Test Module Loading" feature
   - Verify all files are present in the Netlify deploy

## Technical Details

This V3 package ensures the application works by:

1. Providing multiple entry points and redirects to handle any URL structure
2. Using both client-side and server-side redirects for maximum compatibility
3. Including comprehensive error handling throughout the application
4. Adding diagnostic tools to pinpoint any remaining issues
5. Ensuring the serverless function works consistently to provide mock data
